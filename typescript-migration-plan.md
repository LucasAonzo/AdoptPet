# TypeScript Migration Plan for AdoptMe

## Current Status (as of March 5, 2024)
- Overall progress: ~40% (38/95 files)
- Core infrastructure files mostly converted (database, configuration)
- Some utilities converted (errorHandler, dateUtils, validationUtils)
- Key services converted (authService, animalService, chatService)
- Primary components starting to be converted (34% complete)

## Migration Phases (Remaining Work)

### Phase 1: Complete Core Infrastructure (In Progress)
- ✓ Convert database files (100% complete)
- ✓ Convert configuration files (67% complete)
- ⟳ Convert remaining utility files (50% complete)
  - Priority: apiUtils.js - needed by multiple components
  - Priority: formattingUtils.js - used across the app
  - Medium: analyticsUtils.js
  - Medium: permissionUtils.js
  - Low: debugUtils.js

### Phase 2: State Management (Next Focus)
- ⟳ Convert remaining state management files (33% complete)
  - Priority: animalStore.js - central to animal listing functionality
  - Priority: settingsStore.js - affects app-wide settings

### Phase 3: Services Layer (50% Complete)
- ⟳ Convert remaining services (50% complete)
  - Priority: notificationService.js - used by multiple components
  - Priority: locationService.js - critical for map functionality
  - Medium: paymentService.js
  - Low: analyticsService.js

### Phase 4: Core Components (34% Complete)
- ⟳ Convert primary shared components (33% complete)
  - Priority: AnimalFilter.js - needed for search functionality
  - Priority: FeaturedSection.js - core home page component
  - Medium: UserAvatar.js
  - Medium: RatingStars.js

### Phase 5: Screens (36% Complete)
- ⟳ Convert authentication screens (0% complete)
  - Priority: LoginScreen.js
  - Priority: RegisterScreen.js
  - Medium: ForgotPasswordScreen.js
- ⟳ Convert primary screens (40% complete)
  - Priority: ProfileScreen.js
  - Medium: SettingsScreen.js
  - Low: NotificationsScreen.js
- ⟳ Convert animal management screens (25% complete)
  - Priority: MyAnimalsScreen.js
  - Medium: EditAnimalScreen.js
  - Medium: AdoptionRequestsScreen.js

### Phase 6: Secondary Components
- ⟳ Convert profile components (0% complete)
  - Priority: ProfileHeader.js
  - Priority: UserStats.js
  - Medium: UserSettings.js
- ⟳ Convert remaining animal components (17% complete)
  - Priority: AnimalFilter.js
  - Medium: AnimalCarousel.js
  - Medium: AdoptionForm.js

## Timeline Estimation
- Phase 1: 1-2 days (infrastructure files are fewer but critical)
- Phase 2: 1-2 days (state management files are complex but fewer in number)
- Phase 3: 2-3 days (services require careful typing of API responses)
- Phase 4: 3-4 days (components are numerous and have more complex props)
- Phase 5: 3-5 days (screens integrate multiple components and state)
- Phase 6: 3-4 days (remaining components)

Total estimated time: 13-20 days (working at current pace)

## Migration Approach

### For Each File:
1. Create TypeScript interfaces for props, state, and data structures
2. Convert the file from .js to .ts/.tsx
3. Add type annotations to variables, functions, and parameters
4. Fix any type errors identified by TypeScript
5. Test the component to ensure functionality is preserved
6. Update imports in dependent files if needed

### Testing Strategy:
1. After each file conversion, run TypeScript compiler to check for errors
2. Test affected functionality in the app to verify behavior hasn't changed
3. For critical components, write simple Jest tests to verify props handling

## Risk Mitigation
- Begin each day by converting a few simpler files to build momentum
- When stuck on a complex file, temporarily use `any` types and add TODOs
- Document any technical debt created in the process for later cleanup
- Keep commits small and focused on specific components/modules
